name/Handgun
shortDescription/Inches away from a pool of blood, a handgun rests on the floor’s surface.
longDescription//Embedded into the sleek blue steal of the barrel, just in front of the trigger, is a stout rectangular ammo clip feeding into the chamber. Its black grip curves slightly with the shape of one’s palm. If the large barrel is any indication the handgun has some stopping power.
