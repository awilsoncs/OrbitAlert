description/Bathed in blue light, lush trees stretch their branches towards high ceiling of fans. The soft hum of the whipping blades slightly trembles the walls and floor. Beneath the transparent floor panels mounds of soft dirt ran the length of the area. The suffocating blue light emanated from the high glass walls fills every crevice and blankets every surface. Amongst the thin trunked trees, an assortment of shrubs stood; their roots running deep beneath the floor and mingling amongst the dirt. Water quickly trickles down along the wall’s surface collecting along a reservoir along the perimeter of the area and sinking into the soil below. The dripping water sent echoes throughout, emulating the sounds of rain. The green house flourishes sending oxygen to the fans and creating moisture, a small slice of earth amongst a metallic giant.
