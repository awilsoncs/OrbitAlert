description/Spent shell casings litter the floor among the pools and streaks of blood, the smell of gun powder still lingers. Bullet impacts pepper the metallic walls and shredded surfaces of numerous security screens as if the shooters didn’t know where to fire. Green mist seeps in through vents near the floor, coagulated blood bubbling as the mist settles. Among the blood splattered consoles what seems to be a security recording continues to loop guttural screams and gunfire. The chaotic screams of men and woman meld together into one gruesome cry of pain. The last stand that, had taken place some time ago, echoes still.
