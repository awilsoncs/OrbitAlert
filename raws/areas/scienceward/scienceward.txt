name/Science Ward
description/Emerging from the thin layer of green mist, that has began to slowly invade the Foyer, is the massive body of a telescope. It stretches from the center of the foyer and travels upward towards through the high ceiling where its revolving eye rests on the outer side of The Neptune’s Hull. Lining the high square walls are maintenance walkways, steel gratings that hug the telescope’s body and move up towards the shadowed ceiling. Behind the body of the telescope is a massive wall protruding outward. “Neptune Science Ward” is stamped high on the white plated walls. The rest of the foyer walls are transparent glass looking on into the surrounding laboratories. One lab has red emergency lights spilling into the foyer another has green mist curling and pressing against the transparent wall. It seems the labs were not spared whatever befell The Neptune.
